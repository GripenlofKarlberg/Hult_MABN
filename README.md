/*
In the h1b project data regarding foreigners applying for a work visa in the United States is used.
The data is taken from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The idea behind the project was to modify and analyze the data to write a recommendation for a 
fictional client looking to get employed in the US. Before any data analysis, a profile was created 
for the client, age, professional background, education level, and which industry the individual 
would like to enter. Knowing the client, the necessary queries could be written and an appropriate
recommendation could be written based on the data analyzed from the queries outputs.

However, before the data could be analysed in SQL the dataset was cleaned in power query and later 
uploaded to a Microsoft Azure.
